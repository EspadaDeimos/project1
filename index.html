I am a 30 year old father of two currently working as the Shipping Director at a small company called Phoenix Electrotek. I have one boy and one girl, Xavier (7) and Kylie (5) and have been married to my beautiful, amazing wife Courtney for 5 years now. I love anime, gaming and Ohio State! I am currently in a Cybersecurity class through Ohio State in conjunction with U2 education. I have always had a love and fascination for technology and taking this class has been one of the best decisions I have made and I hope to use it as a spring board to get into the cybersecurity field and become a CS professional! Down below I will talk about a couple of cyber security topics that I researched and found interesting or polarizing. Feel free to email me or visit my LinkedIn page with any questions or comments!

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
              <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700;">Its threat to your online confidentiality and privacy.&nbsp;</span>
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">

              <img src="/images/images.jpg" align="center" style="width: 583px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic" width="259">The Restrict Act aka &nbsp;Bill S. 686 or as most of us have probably heard it called by: The TikTok ban. You may be wondering what a bill that would ban TikTok has any relevance to cyber security but the truth is, TikTok is just a front to distract from what this bill will allow the federal government to do. It is a distraction that hopes to lead the rest of the internet and population to not care about what this bill really aims to do: remove any privacy you have left. A little background first, without getting to much into the politics of the situation, TikTok is essentially being targeted and used as a stepping stone for a bipartisan effort to remove "adversaries" from collecting data on American citizens. TikTok CEO has been in and out of congressional meetings for the past couple weeks to answer questions regarding how TikTok and its parent company, Byte Dance, collect data using TikTok and who gets access to that data with a particular focus on the Chinese government. Again, without trying to go too deep into the political nature of this issue it boils down to this: lobbyists have "convinced" representatives on both sides that TikTok, an app used by millions to consume news, share tips, tricks and trades and put out content ranging from musical to theater to comedy, is a massive front by the Chinese government to collect data on US citizens and is a threat to the country as whole and should be banned, entirely, from use in the United States. It definitely has NOTHING to do with the fact that TikTok has quickly become the go to platform for millions, because of its inclusive feel and algorithm that leads its user to content they actually want to see instead of divisive content meant to make them argue, instead of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Ok, on to the bill itself.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <br>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">First lets point out the irony that this bill, despite being known as the TikTok ban has ZERO mentions or references to TikTok or ByteDance. They are not in the bill, AT ALL. It's almost like this bill has nothing to do with TikTok. To start, the bill allows the President to appoint a "Secretary of Communication" that secretary then has the power to form their own committee with zero voter input that has ZERO obligation to disclose <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">anything</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 700;">.&nbsp;</span>This committee will have the ability to ban and deem anything inappropriate or a "risk to security" at any time. What does this entail? Well, just about anything that connects to the internet falls under their jurisdiction. Routers, modems, door bell cameras, video games, streaming apps and any other hardware, software or any other product integral to telecommunications products and services that are manufactured by or used to communicate with "foreign adversaries". Who are they? Well currently the bill includes China, Russia, Cuba, Iran, Venezuela and a few others but these can change at anytime to include whomever they want. This also extends to virtual hardware like VPNs. This essentially means that they can tap into and monitor you through just about anything, without telling you, whenever they want so long as they feel it is a risk. If we can take a lesson from history and events like WWI, WWII or the Cold War it is that the bar for meeting "suspicious or inappropriate" behavior in situations like this is very, very, <span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">very&nbsp;</span> low. The scary part? Using VPNs to bypass banned apps would be deemed a criminal act and could result in a MINIMUM TWENTY YEAR prison sentence and a <span style="font-style: italic;">minimum</span> fine of $250,000. That fine could be as high as $1 million if you knowingly did so to access banned content. You know how you like to use your VPN to change your location to access that series on Netflix or Hulu? Well you better hope the Secretary of Communication or its committee doesn't feel your being a threat to national security by doing so. Why? Well remember how I said the bar is historically very low? If this committee feels you have passed that bar, not only can they access anything they want, at any time without telling you like mentioned previously but they can go through your emails, text messages, Insta messages etc and censor it.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">Your privacy, your confidentiality and your freedom to chose what you consume and access has never been more threatened. If passed, this bill would allow the Federal government to ban anything it deems inappropriate extremely quickly and without warning. It would allow them to effectively FREELY invade the privacy of all our homes, networks and devices to monitor us with no consent or knowledge under the flimsiest of pretexts that the committee would set for itself, a committee formed with ZERO American voter input. From a cyber security stand point, as we strive to protect consumers privacy and confidentiality, this is scary. There is no protecting from this, there is no code, no software, no patch that could prevent the government from spying on you at any time. I hope for all of us that this bill does not pass, you can read the full bill &nbsp;</span>

          <h1 style="text-align: center;">VPN: Do you NEED one?</h1>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">Odds are if you have watched YouTube, TikTok or been on any other social media site lately you have come across or listened to an ad for a VPN. What is it? What does it do? How does it work? Do I really need one? These are all questions I will address along with the benefits and drawbacks of VPNs and in the end give my opinion on if I believe they are a NEED or just a preference.&nbsp;<img src="/images/VPN.webp" align="center" style="width: 583px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic" width="531">Lately VPNs have become more prominent in the everyday visual of most internet users and more and more companies have been popping up offering their services. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Cyberghost and on and on have begun regularly sponsoring YouTube videos and buying up ad spots on social media platforms to promote their VPN but what exactly is a VPN?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">A VPN or virtual private network is software that was created to protect your online privacy and make for a much more difficult life for a hacker trying to steal your information by taking your traffic and location and making it anonymous. In simple terms, a VPN takes your IP address and traffic and redirects it through the network to a specially configured remote server that is owned and run by the VPN host. From there the server forwards your traffic to the site you are visting, the site will see the VPN server as your origin of traffic instead of your device. This basically means when you go online instead of your home computer, laptop, phone, workstation etc being the source of your data, the VPN server is, effectively hiding your IP address and location from anyone and especially from any hackers trying to steal it. The best VPNs manage thousands of servers and update their IPs regularly so sites don't have enough time to blacklist them, keeping you private.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">VPNs do more than just make you anonymous though, they can also encrypt all the data you send over the internet, protect your privacy and some even block malicious websites, ads and trackers. VPNs are perfectly legal in most countries with a few exceptions. Reliable VPNs offer a variety of privacy features like DNS leak protection, IP leak protection and no no-log policies.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">All sounds amazing right? It does! But, there's always a but, there are some drawbacks to using a VPN. First off is the fact that your connection speed will take hit, a small one yes, but still a hit. Since your traffic has to travel further to reach VPN servers and because it takes time to encrypt and decrypt your traffic, its normal for your connection speed to decrease a little. Second, there are untrustworthy VPN providers out there. With the less reputable ones you have no guarantee that they wont look at your browsing activities and sell it or share it with third parties. Some providers could even be forced to share your information with the government.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">Another drawback is that some websites block VPN users. These sites will check your IP address against a known list of VPN server IPs and if there is a match, obstruct your traffic. Luckily this is pretty easy to overcome by connecting to different server in the same region. Lastly, some banks and companies like PayPal may flag a security breach if they detect you logging in from a foreign IP. It's a small inconvience as you will have to contact your bank to resolve the issue but it is possible.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;">So, is a VPN a must? In my opinion the answer is yes! The benefits of a VPN heavily outweigh any drawbacks and when it comes to your online privacy and protecting yourself from attacks and hackers VPNs are essential, plus you get to watch that Netflix series that isn't available in your country or for you Canadian, you get Hulu! You don't need to go with the most expensive VPN provider out there but I do believe that any regular visitor to the Internet (lets face it, that's all of us) should have one. &nbsp;Make sure you avoid the less reputable providers and look for ones that offer 256-bit encryption, automatic kill switch, DNS and IP leak protection, large server coverage, strict no-log policies and customer service. Keep an eye out or ask if they have RAM-based servers, these servers permanently delete records each time they are rebooted so even if a VPN is legally forced to give information on you, there won't be any. You don't need to break the bank but I believe everyone should have at least a basic VPN service to protect themselves while surfing online!</span>
